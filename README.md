Mercado Libre Growth Analysis
Youâ€™re a growth analyst at Mercado Libre. With over 200 million users, Mercado Libre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. You've been tasked with analyzing the company's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow. So, you want to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

#### Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic.

#### Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet.
